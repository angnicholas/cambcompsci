# General Advice

_take it with a bucket of salt, ymmv_

## Workload Estimation

- I think a good rule of thumb for estimating the amount of workload (lectures + supervision slots + homework) would be to take the number listed by the website and multiplying by 2
    - For eg. a 12-lecture course will typically have 3 supervisions, each one requiring 3 hours of work, so the total would be 12 + 3 + 9 = 24
    - Typically I'd aim to never work too much on a piece of supervision work - if I find myself spending too long (ie more than 3-4 hours), I'd typically just skip the questions I'm stuck on and just give a broad sketch of the answer
    - I've found that doing this lets me learrn more during the actual session - by being able to identify the areas where I have doubts and clarify them quickly
    - Also it helps to prioritise breadth - I'd rather do 100% questions 70% well as opposed to 50% of the questions 100% well since in the end I would be tested on all 100% of the content and it's much more likely I can make up the 30% in each area

- That works out to 185 x 2 = 370 hours of work, adding on 300 hours of exam preparation for a total of 670 hours, divided by 40 weeks to get around 17 hours of work a week, or 2.5-3 hours of work per day
    - In reality, accounting for things like travelling / hobbies / etc., I've found myself averaging around 4 hours a day on average during the regular season, and around 5-6 during exam times.



## Exams / studying / performing well
- Main idea is to figure out what the examiner wants - my mental model of exams is to treat it as a machine learning task: 
    - the past year papers + your consults is your training data, 
    - the exam is your holdout set
    - your inference task is to maximise score where your input is question
    - so in order to close the error, just get as much training data as you can and be as confident in your prediction/model as possible

- Generally everyone has their own "preferred" way of studying - just try to figure out what seems to work best for yourself and find a way to establish a system where you don't have to think too much about it - just sit down, open your laptop and do

- But generally most modules are self-contained and grindable from past year papers - but if the answers are not good enough it helps to be able to consult and clarify (I typically store a running list of all the clarifications and gradually cut the list down after searching stuff online / asking friends / asking supervisors)

- Another heuristic I use is to prioritise breadth - generally I try to go over all the content as quickly as possible and keep doing that over multiple passes, rather than to go super in depth into a topic and proceed sequentially
    - I think the main benefit of doing this is that it helps me very quickly identify what areas need more work and what areas are alright - which really helps me take advantage of the opportunities to clarify doubts early and focus on the most important areas

# General Advice

_take it with a bucket of salt, ymmv_

## Exams / studying / performing well
- Main idea is to figure out what the examiner wants - my mental model of exams is to treat it as a machine learning task: 
    - the past year papers + your consults is your training data, 
    - the exam is your holdout set
    - your inference task is to maximise score where your input is question
    - so in order to close the error, just get as much training data as you can and be as confident in your prediction/model as possible

- Generally everyone has their own "preferred" way of studying - just try to figure out what seems to work best for yourself and find a way to establish a system where you don't have to think too much about it - just sit down, open your laptop and do

- But generally most modules are self-contained and grindable from past year papers - but if the answers are not good enough it helps to be able to consult and clarify (I typically store a running list of all the clarifications and gradually cut the list down after searching stuff online / asking friends / asking supervisors)

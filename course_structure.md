# Course Structure

## Year 1
- In total, there will be 12 Computer Science courses, all of which are compulsory
- Each course runs for 1 term which will be either 8 or 9 weeks. (some go for longer than a term)
- Each course will contain anywhere between 8 to 24 hours of lectures in total. [This link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/part1a.html) shows the number of lecture hours - so for eg. if a course has 12 hours of lectures and runs for 8 weeks, it will mean on average around 1-2 hours of lectures per week
- Each course also typically includes 2-4 supervisions which are 1-hour long sessions with a supervisor (either a PhD student or faculty) where you go through the material in depth
    - Typically it is 2-3 students assigned to one supervisor
    - Usually there would be some work assigned, on average I'd say 2-3 hours of work for one supervision would be reasonable


- In addition there is the NST Mathematics module



and typically includes 2-3 hours of lectures a week, and 3 supervisions in total

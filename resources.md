# Resources
Here are some online links which I found were helpful in understanding the material. Where stated, the categorisation is provided:
- **Tutorials** are lecture videos, course notes or handouts which I found were good at explaining the topic
- **Visualisations** are tools which help graphically illustrate an algorithm or concept
- **Blogs** are write-ups / forum posts / articles that illustrate something that is more specific

For the most part I have tried to rank in decreasing order of how helpful they were to me (within each topic)
